# Install

## macOS

First make sure you have Python 3.x installed as well as Pip, the Python package manager.

Pip comes with Python, but if you want to make sure it is installed type:
`python3 -m ensurepip --upgrade`

Depending on your setup, you may need to specify `python` instead of `python3`.

You may need to update your $PATH in order to run python.

For example, to update zshell (MacOS default) do the following:

NOTE: This assumes you know how to use vi or vim<br>
From the command prompt type: `vi ~/.zshrc`
This will open the config file for your zshell where you can make alterations.
Depending on your configuration, you will probably want to add:
`export PATH=~/usr/local/bin/python3/bin:$PATH`

Also, please install pandas with the following line at the command prompt:
`pip3 install pandas`

Depending on your setup, you may need to specify `pip` instead of `pip3`.

Now, just navigate to the src folder. If you are using the terminal type:
`python3 main.py`

It takes a few moments to run, so just be patient. Pretty soon you'll see output to your screen.

Alternately, you can use an IDE to run the main.py file.
